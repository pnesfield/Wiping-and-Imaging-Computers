Setup a chroot image containing a minimal Linux OS to make it as small as possible - it will only be able to run bash scripts from a terminal. 

cat /etc/os-release
sudo apt-get install debootstrap
ls /usr/share/debootstrap/scripts

mkdir Image
cd Image
sudo debootstrap --arch=amd64 --variant=minbase focal chroot
sudo ./mount_for_chroot.sh
sudo chroot chroot

mount_for_chroot.sh

umount_for_chroot.sh

Part19 Configure chroot to run wipe scripts and boot from the USB
=================================================================

Create a PXE bootable image to allow any disk connected to the computer to be wiped.

Configure the chroot image to startup using /init, login as root and then run wipe scripts. 

Create an initrd file. Using the USB created in Part 8, modify the grub menu to boot a linux kernel and the new initrd

In the scripts change [CHANGEME1] to a greater than sign and [CHANGEME2] which are not allowed in youtube!!
 
setup.sh

init

start.sh

menu.sh

erase_script.sh
 Is a renamed copy of wipe.sh in Part 17 

mk_image.sh

grub.cfg

Errata
In the video at 5.50 the linux kernel was copied, it should be moved to save space, as it is not used in initrd. /chroot/boot can and should be empty
